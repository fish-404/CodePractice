# Build a Markdown Previewer

A practice project for [Bulid a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

For some features enhance, I modify the code, so it won't pass the freecodecamp test.

You can view this project in https://codepen.io/fish-404/pen/PobqpaB.

I haven't understand MathJax usage, math problem can't always work well.
