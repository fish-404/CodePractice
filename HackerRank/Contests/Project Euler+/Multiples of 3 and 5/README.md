##### Multiples of 3 and 5

Problem: [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001/problem)

tips:

- A natrual method is traversing 1 to n, but it's inefficient
- You can regard this as a math problem, and multipy it by sum equation
- For large number, you need be careful to handle divide result
