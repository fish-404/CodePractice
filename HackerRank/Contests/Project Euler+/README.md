#### Project Euler+ 

The problems in Project Euler+ is from https://projecteuler.net/archives. 

These problems has many large testing case and may over time limitation if you use simple logic to handle. 

You should optimize your algorithm to pass the test cases. Actually, they are math problem more then program problem.

1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://blog.fish-404.icu/CodePractice/HackerRank/Contests/Project%20Euler+/Multiples%20of%203%20and%205/) [[Python](https://github.com/fish-404/CodePractice/blob/main/HackerRank/Contests/Project%20Euler%2B/Multiples%20of%203%20and%205/Multiple%20of%203%20and%205.py)]
2. Even Fibonacci numbers [[Python](https://github.com/fish-404/CodePractice/blob/main/HackerRank/Contests/Project%20Euler%2B/Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers/Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers.py)]
